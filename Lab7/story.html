    <h1>Writers Block</h1>
        <main>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a girl doing her computer science homework. She had to write a story as part of the hw and that was harder for her than the actual assigment. See, this girl wasn't a very good writer and she had writers block.</p>
            <p>So she sat and she sat. But still nothing came to her. She got up and paced around the room and then stared at her laptop and still nothing.</p>
            <p>Then finally after hours upon hours of thinking, it came to her. She came up with the greatest story of all time. She was about to start writing it and then poof her computer died.</p>
            <p>The End!</p>
